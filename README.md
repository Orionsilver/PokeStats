# PokeStats
To use the LUA script, make another script that imports the pokestats lua and calls do_pokestats() every frame  
  
I do not own any of this code, I basically just ported the whole main.lua to c#.
The slight difference is, it loads in all images in the folders "Barfix", "nstatus", "sprites", "ssprites" and "status".
position is automatically saved.
F5 to reload settings and images.

Files and folder needed to run:
	Barfix/
	nstatus/
	sprites/
	ssprites/
	status/
	expGroups.txt
	
It will look weird if you don't install the font included with the stuff.
If an error occurs at boottime, or runtime, look for a "error.txt" to find the nature.
Settings are stored and changeable in an autogenerated "settings.txt".

Source contains the .cs files I used to compile pokestats.
LuaScripts are not changed from other versions.

SHINIES are not yet included, seems like the stream is running an old version of the script, will change that soon.
